Q1. Slice the given list:
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
      
print(x[7:12]) #slicing from the front 
print(x[-9:-4]) #slicing from the Back
 output:-
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

Q2. Find EVEN NUMBERS using slicing in above list
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
print(x[1::2])

output:- [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]

Q3. Print every fourth number using slicing in above list.
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
print(x[0::4])
Output:-
[1, 5, 9, 13]
